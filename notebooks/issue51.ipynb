    "Thanks for the question. Although the model is obviously very simple, it turned out it has one property which makes it a bit nasty for BayesPy built-in nodes. In short (and loosely speaking), the problem arises because you are conditioning on the same variable q two times for R. This causes a coupling between variables within a same node and BayesPy doesn't support that in general.  Thus, a simple implementation won't work. Anyway, I'll show you what the simple implementation would look like although it won't work. It gives some ideas anyway:"

    "However, you'll get an error that parents are not independent when constructing `R`. BayesPy doesn't support that the same node is as a parent multiple times for another node because in general this would break the expectation computations. If you had two separate groups (e.g., customers and shops), and you did a similar analysis on how the links between customers and shops are grouped, you wouldn't have this issues.\n",

    "Note that this constructions loses the dependencies among the group assignments of the nodes because of the factorization. Another issue with this implementation is that `R` and `q` are lists/arrays containing separate nodes, so the computations won't be as efficient if they were modelled using single nodes with array-based computations. That is, the elements of `R` and `q` cannot be updated simultaneously but must be updated in turns. Thus, this might not scale well to large problems, unfortunately.\n",

    "A better implementation would handle the couplings between the elements of `q` and the elements of `R`. A quite complex approach would be to write `q` as a single categorical variable with $K^N$ states where each state codes group assignments for all nodes and then write other nodes based on that construction. But, uh, I didn't look into this, probably becomes very complex and requires some node operations that are not yet implemented in BayesPy. I think there is a much better solution: as `q` and `R` are discrete categorical/Bernoulli variables, they both could be included in a single node which handles couplings and performs computations by using the junction tree algorithm. I haven't implemented it yet, there's an issue for it: https://github.com/bayespy/bayespy/issues/37 But I hope I'll find time to implement it soon, I've noticed that quite many reported issues are related to discrete variables and they could be solved just by using that new node. I'll try to implement the new feature in such a way that this construction you need would be easy (or at least possible) to implement."
