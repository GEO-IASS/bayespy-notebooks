    "You may have noticed that you need to use separate nodes for each `X1`, `X2`, `X3` etc. This is because `theta` nodes have dependencies that can't be represented by any single built-in node but need to be separated. Thus, all the child nodes need to be separate too. If you have a large amount of `X1, ..., Xn` nodes, you probably want to generate them programmatically, maybe using list comprehensions or for loops. There could be a node class to concatenate several nodes into a single \"array\", but it's not implemented yet, and I doubt it would make any significant difference here.\n",
